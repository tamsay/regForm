A simple registration form with only javascript validation

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5977206b-a1e4-4cfd-9a69-96befb39fc2c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/agitated-mcclintock-582995/deploys)

This task is the first of the #DevTask project hosted by saucecode. It is a simple form with validation being done by Javascript alone. All forms of HTML5 in-built validation was bypassed and the site is fully responsive on mobile views as well.
